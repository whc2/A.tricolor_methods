## Genome assembly
We documented the pipeline used in the paper to scaffold contigs assembled by [hifiasm](https://github.com/chhylp123/hifiasm) by Oxford Nanopore Ultra-long reads. Please refer to [methods for assmebly](01.assmelby.md).

## Transcriptome analysis
This part included computation of gene expression, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) detection and gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. Please refer to [methods for transcriptome](02.transcriptome.md).
